# 6. newTodos=[...Todos]

```
let newTodos =[...todos] ; // why ... & mot direct newtodos = todos  ,react

Good question üëç Let‚Äôs break it down in the context of React:

newTodos = todos

This just copies the reference.

Both newTodos and todos now point to the same array in memory.

If you mutate newTodos (e.g. newTodos.push(...)), you‚Äôre also mutating todos.

React may not re-render, because React state checks are usually done by comparing references. If the reference hasn‚Äôt changed, React assumes nothing changed.

newTodos = [...todos]

The spread operator (...) creates a shallow copy of the array.

newTodos is now a new array in memory, with the same elements.

If you modify newTodos, the original todos stays unchanged.

React detects the new reference and will trigger a re-render when you update state.
